  ALT_welcome_events.0001.desc: "Welcome to third iteration of Arcane Legacy! Mod made to introduce magic to CK3, this time with different approach. If previous versions where about quick and flashy magic, this time it is about more occult side. If before magic was in the end something known by most, now only selected few know. And I hope you will like this new approach!\n\nBut anyways, Thanks for downloading my mod\n\n\nVecsonON"
